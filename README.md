# BRAVO Compare

This code was developed as part of a British Council funded project \*\*\*\*

It is a proof of concept application to facilitate online identification by matching of forest plot voucher specimens with reference specimens in the world's herbaria.

This application does not intend to be feature complete deployable code but it forms the foundation of future projects that will take the concept into full production.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
